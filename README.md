## Quick start

1. Clone the repository with `git clone --depth=1 {URL}`
2. Setup the database on `config/database.js` (there's an example file there to be used with PostgreSQL ðŸ˜‰ )
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn` (click here if [you don't have Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install))
4. Create the development and test databases you have setup on `config/database.js`
5. Run the application in development mode with `npm run dev`
6. Access `http://localhost:3000/api/users` and you're ready to go!

## Scripts

You'll run them with `npm run <script name>` or `yarn run <script name>`:

- `dev`: Run the application in development mode
- `start`: Run the application in production mode (prefer not to do that in development)
